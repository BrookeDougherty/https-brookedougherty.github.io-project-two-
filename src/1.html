        <p>
          The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
          smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
          proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
          electricity.

      <p>
        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.
        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already
        surrounded by four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal Power has
        proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin
        construction late this year or in early 2010. The following information
        provides background to explain why coal plants are at the center of a
        national debate over energy production and consumption.

        What’s The Connection Between Coal and Electricity?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired
          power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the
          turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the largest
          coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across the
          nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the South and in
          the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the West Coast,
          where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power.

        If Coal Is So Important To Electricity Generation, Why Are Some People
        Concerned About Building New Coal-Fired Power Plants?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has advocated a
          moratorium on building new coal plants until technology is developed
          to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere.
          Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide at current
          rates – even just for the next 10 years – will create “a different
          planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated
          coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea
          level.” The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County
          would release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide
          annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

        Why Are There So Many Electricity-Generating Coal Plants Near Meigs
        County?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history.
          The county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. An
          experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology
          to store carbon dioxide underground, is under construction in West
          Virginia near Meigs County's southern border. In addition, a
          coal-to-liquids facility and two other coal-fired power plants have
          been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
          appear to be on hold. Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest
          counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a
          Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new plant,
          argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry.
          “When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you
          can't speak out about it,” she says.

        Some Meigs County Residents Are Concerned About The Health Effects Of
        Coal Plants. Why?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
          millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
          manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
          the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these chemicals has been
          linked to human health problems, such as cancer, gastrointestinal
          disorders, impaired motor skills and neurological damage. Kent Carson,
          a spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said the proposed plant
          will use new technology to control pollutants. “This will be the
          cleanest facility of its type in the state,” he said.

        Can It Be Proved That The Coal Plants Are Responsible For Health
        Problems In Meigs County?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
          problems of a particular individual. “We’re exposed to a soup of
          chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of the Center for Air Quality
          at Ohio University. Crist said health problems can be influenced by
          interactions between chemicals, as well as by lifestyle factors. In
          addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
          correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are
          more likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than 30
          percent of adult residents of Southeast Ohio smoke, compared to only
          about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio counties. Crist said tall
          smokestacks on the existing plants probably disperse most pollutants
          away from Meigs County. But he said it is impossible to know for sure
          what residents are being exposed to, because no agency monitors the
          county’s air.

        So What Do We Know About Air Quality and Health In Meigs County?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          An analysis by USA Today estimated that the air quality at Southern
          Elementary School in Meigs County is worse than the air quality at 97
          percent of the nation's schools. USA Today identified two of the coal
          plants near Meigs County as major contributors to pollution at the
          school. In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life
          expectancy among men in any Ohio county, according to data compiled by
          Harvard University (women ranked 26th worst of 88 counties). Meigs
          County also has the highest death rate of any Ohio county for lung and
          bronchus cancer, according to the Ohio Department of Health.

        Despite The Suspected Health Effects, Wouldn’t a New Plant Create
        Much-Needed Jobs?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
          than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than
          25 percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office
          of Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's
          median income was $27,287, about half the national average. Many Meigs
          County residents support the new plant for the jobs it may bring to
          the community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in favor
          of the plant at public hearings. “My family will benefit by me going
          up there and working,” he said. “If I reached in your pocket and took
          $200,000 out of your pocket, would you like it?” he said, referring to
          the income he estimated he could earn during the four years it would
          take to build the plant. But no one can guarantee how many jobs will
          actually go to Meigs County residents or how much they will pay. “We
          all know that not all the workers are going to come from Meigs
          County,” said Sheets, the construction worker. “They’ll be from all
          over the country.”
