    DEBATING COAL'S FUTURE
    <p>
      The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering smokestacks
      of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been proposed, the
      latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets electricity.

    Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
    plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by uncertain
    economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the plants to be
    abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems. One such coal
    fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already surrounded by
    four coal-fired power plants. American Municipal Power has proposed building
    a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin construction late this year
    or in early 2010. The following information provides background to explain
    why coal plants are at the center of a national debate over energy
    production and consumption.

  What’s the connection between coal and electricity?

  <p>
    Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired power
    plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the turbines of an
    electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the
    world and burns it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating
    electricity from coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less
    often used in regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and
    natural gas are bigger sources of power.

  If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people
  concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?

    In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has advocated a
    moratorium on building new coal plants until technology is developed to
    prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere. Hansen has
    warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide at current rates – even
    just for the next 10 years – will create “a different planet – one without
    sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated
    with storms and a continuously rising sea level.” The proposed American
    Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would release an estimated 5.5 million
    tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

  Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs County?
</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The
    county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. An experimental
    site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology to store carbon
    dioxide underground, is under construction in West Virginia near Meigs
    County's southern border. In addition, a coal-to-liquids facility and two
    other coal-fired power plants have been proposed for the region, although at
    least some of those plans appear to be on hold. Meanwhile, Meigs County is
    one of the poorest counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data.
    Elisa Young, a Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new
    plant, argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry.
    “When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you can't
    speak out about it,” she says.
